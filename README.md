# Travel Blog with Contentful

The main goal of this project is to learn how to use Contentful.

### Technologies

This travel blog was created using Next.js 13, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The content for this blog is managed through [Contentful.](https://www.contentful.com/)

## Project Improvements

1. The data is revalidated on-demand. This allows me to create or update content on my site without redeploying it.
   The main benefits are: better performance, reduced backend load and faster builds

### TODO

[] Create a preview.
[] Create a draft mode.
