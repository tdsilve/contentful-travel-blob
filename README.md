### Technologies

This travel blog was created using Next.js 13, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The content for this blog is managed through [Contentful.](https://www.contentful.com/)

## Project Details

1. I created a webhook between Vercel and Contentful. So every time the content changes, a new build is triggered.
