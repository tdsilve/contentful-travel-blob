# Travel Blog with Contentful

The main goal of this project is to build a Travel Blog using Contentful as the data source.

## Check the result:

### Technologies

This travel blog was created using Next.js 13, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The content for this blog is managed through [Contentful.](https://www.contentful.com/)

## Project Details

1. I created a webhook between Vercel and Contentful. So every time the content changes, a new build is triggered.

### TODO

[] Create a preview.

[] Create a draft mode.

[] Implement revalidated data on-demand. This will allow me to create or update content on my site without redeploying it.
The main benefits are: better performance, reduced backend load and faster builds

[] Improve images loading
